## Getting started

Install _Oh, Snap!_ from FAB, or build it from source, your choice!

### How do I use it?

Once installed & enabled, Oh Snap provides two Level Editor commands.

After selecting two Actors in the Level Outliner, right-click, and under the Snapping submenu, you should see "Snap to $FIRST_ACTORNAME" and "Snap to $SECOND_ACTORNAME". Selecting either will snap one actor to the other.

**Keyboard Shortcuts**: You can find the Keyboard Shortcuts and customize their bindings by going to Editor Preferences and searching for "Snap A to B".

**Snapping behavior**: To customize what Transform components are included when snapping Actors to each other, go to `Editor Preferences -> Level Editor -> Snapping`.
